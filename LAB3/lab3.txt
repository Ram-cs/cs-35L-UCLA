lab3.txt: A record of command and its use and an explanation
on why commands were used. for python i have 
used online resources.


I downloaded the Coreutils 7.6 package. I downloaded 
the package and untar it from the dictionary i created

1.
Then, did wget to download coreutils-7.6 by using 
wet ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
tar -xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

2.
after downloaded, I installed the file as showed in prefix.
the following command helped to coreutilsInstall directory 
in the home directory.
To install the file:
cd coreutils-7.6/
Made a new directory: by using the command mkdir newDir
Run:  ./configure --prefix="$PWD/newDir”
after downloaded, needed to install package in coureutilsInstall
dictionary and did that with make 
Run: make 
Run: make install 

3.
i just went and export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'
Bug can be seen by  ./ls -l bin/bash
The correct version is:  ls -l
Difference in date format can be seen.

4.
There are issues after running ls command, so started 
patch the issue up. I did by cd’ing back into coreutils
-7.6 directory and creating a file called patch_file 
with the copied and pasted text from Brady’s patch. 
Once done, run the following command within the 
current directory: patch -p1 < patch_file

and then, finally ran the make command. Now we saw 
that the ls command in the coreutils-7.6/src/ directory
 shows the behaviour of displaying the
timestamp (Month-Date-Year/Hour) instead of (Year-Month-Date.)

after applying the patch, it seems like fewer file ran with 
make compared to original command. 

5. Ran again, the less file executed this time because of 
ls.c was modified. 
6. Then touched new file and then ran ./ls - l bin/bash
This time it gives correct answer.
