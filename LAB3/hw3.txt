File: hw3.txt- This file is a question’s answer from Q1-Q4

1.
the line case_long_iso_time_style: has been removed from the code
Its a goto statement in a switch statement and repeated twice. 
This line was not appropriate to remove because because goto line
was removed and the label never referenced.

2.
It mainly causes two problems:
- as new patched version of coreutils-7.6 assumed the readers in 
international level can read the date in English, but in reality 
it may not be a case. So due to timestamp format it may be a problem 
for international clients/ companies to get confusion
- 2nd ly it only works for patched (a specific to a timestamp format), so 
if there is a program written in non-patched version, it would create a
problem running program in this platform.

3. In the linux, a unix like system, file /dev/null is an empty file.
It is kind of trash in a GUI, but like GUI, can’t recover the file.
when trying to run this file
python readline.py /dev/null
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "readline.py", line 71, in <module>
    main()
  File "readline.py", line 65, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "readline.py", line 35, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.12/lib/python2.7/random.py", 
line 275, in choice
return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises 
IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range
Its says list index out of range at the end.It is because python
read the script from the file and index the elements but there is no 
elements found. Or python tries to access elements of the file using
arguments in the brackets and there is not elements at that index.


4.
The output is: 
File "./randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
It si because of the tuple unpacking. Python 2 has automatic 
tuple unpacking while python3 has tuple parameter unpacking 
that that was removed causing the syntax error different.
to fix this, one can reference multiple arguments with the 
single passing parameter.
