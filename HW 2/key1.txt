To get the file exer1.html, first wget <URL>. Once file downloaded, copy downloaded file into exer1 by cp <downloaded_fil> <exer1.html>
2ndly in terminal open Emacs. To open the file in Emacs C-x C-f <exer1.html>

1.1
1. C-x C-f <exer1.html> open the file in Emacs
2. C-s <PUBLIC> and Enter. forward search to search first occurrence of word “PUBLIC”, ‘Enter’ put the cursor after the word “PUBLIC”
3. C-s <Laboratory> and Enter, note: to find later occurrence of the word, use C-s as per occurrence then Enter. Then M-b to put the curser first letter of the word “Laboratory”
4. C-s <self-referential> and Enter, note: to find later occurrence of the word, use C-s as per occurrence then Enter. Then M-b put the curser first letter of the word “self-referential”
5. C-s <arrow> and Enter, note: to find later occurrence of the word, use C-s as per occurrence then Enter. Then M-b put first letter of the word “arrow”
6. C-e move cursor to the end of the line
7.C-a cursor beginning of the current line
8.M-<
9.I didn’t use arrow key
10. C-x C-c



1.2
1. C-x C-f exer2.html
2. M-g M-g 18 and Enter,C-’space’ to set the mark, then C-e select line 18, then C-d to delete line
3. C-s DELETEME DELETEME DELETEME,then use C-k
4. C-s https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_comment#Comments, then use C-k to delete
note: for 3 and 4 use C-s for surfing to get to the right place
5.C-s <!-, then C-d 



1.3
Open emacs
1. C-x C-f exer3.html Enter
2. C-s Assignment 1 M-% Assignment 37 Enter yy(for just two first Assignment 1) Enter
3. C-s UTF-8 m-% US-ASCII Enter y Enter
4. C-s <ol> Enter as per blank line
5. C-x C-s C-x C-c


1.4
1. cat exer2.html exer2.diff >exer4.html
2. open emacs
3. M-> C-SP C-f M-w C-y
4. Repeat the same process until its identical
5. C-d or M-d or C-SP C-w
6. C-x u or C-_
7. using cursor movement with C-f or M-f or C-b or M-b or C-a or C-e as desired and turned into the comments by using “<— - - >”
8.C-s <ol>, 7 instances of <ol> , C-s <Ol> M-% <Ol> yyyyyyy Enter


1.5
1. C-x C-f Enter, (Enter +) to create ‘junk’ under home.
2. put the cursor on junk and hit Enter to get into junk file, then C-x c-f to create hello.c
copy and paste the source code into emacs
3.M-x compile Enter, Delete (make -k), gcc hello.c -o new_file_name Enter
4.M-x shell, ./new_file_name >hello-out
5.C-x b hello-out
  C-u M-! ./ab.out
#include <stdio.h>
int
main (void)
{
  char n = '\n';
  char b = '\\';
  char q = '"';
  char const *p = "#include <stdio.h>%cint%cmain (void)%c{%c  char n = '%cn';%c  char b = '%c%c';%c  char q = '%c';%c  char const *p = %c%s%c;%c  printf (p, n, n, n, n, b, n, b, b, n, q, n, q, p, q, n, n, n, n);%c  return 0;%c}%c";
  printf (p, n, n, n, n, b, n, b, b, n, q, n, q, p, q, n, n, n, n);
  return 0;
}



1.6
1. C-x b Enter
2. (random) C-j, get a random value (-737004071327947834), note:,put cursor at the end of the line
3. (setq x (random)) C-j, get x = (-1000278277145540493), 
	again (setq y (random)), then C-j, get y = (-407454645627560705)
	note: to use and work C-j put cursor at the end of the line in both case
4. (* x y) C-j, got (*x y) = -78828042525770099, which is not mathematically correct and may be overflowing. note: use C-j put the cursor at the end of the line
5. M-: (*x y) Enter, got a value = (-78828042525770099. this time results remain the same which is mathematically incorrect value. 
6. This random number not random in mathematical sense because of several reason. because of the memory capacities there is finite ranges to search from while in mathematically random number should search from infinite range. secondly, while found the random number, there is not any pattern between executives numbers.
7.for the two variable to calculate the trueness,(2), so both has to be wrong which is 0.
