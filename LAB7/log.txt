Steps taken:
1. Had to setup environment:
sudo apt-get install openssh-server
sudo apt-get install openssh-client
 - installs the openssh-server and openssh-client

1. Setup for Server
ssh-keygen
 - used to make a pait of keys
file1
 - it asks us to make file to save the key
 - we named it file1
(password)
 - it then asked us to make a passcode for this key
 - the passcode it used to decrypt the file holding the key from the local disk
 - it will make two files
   - the files are file1 and file1.pub
   - the file1.pub is the public key

sudo useradd -d /home/ -m <username>
sudo passwd <username>
 - creates an account for the client on the server
 - it will ask to enter password twice

cd /home/
 - go to home directory

sudo mkdir .ssh
 - creates .ssh directory for the new user

sudo chown -R <username> .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh
 - changes ownership and permission on .ssh directory

hostname -I
 - to find IP Address of server
 - will be used later for client

ping <IP-Address>
 - to check if address is correct

3. Setup for Client
ssh-keygen
 - generate public and private keys

ssh-copy-id -i <username>@<IP-Address>
 - copies our public key to the server for the key-based authentication
 - use ip address found from host
 - use username made on the host

ssh-add
 - adds private key to authentication agent or ssh-agent
 - will ask for the password again


ssh <username>@<IP-Address>
ssh -X <username>@<ip-address>
 - SSH into server

The client will now be connected to the server.
The client will now be able to run commands on
the remote host from the client computer.
Can look through directories of the host from the client.

Can now do the command on client:
xterm
 - will bring out shell window on the host
 - typed command xterm, displayed on displays the host
