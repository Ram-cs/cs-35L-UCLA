1. Since everything is encrypted, it would be secure if they
observed all bytes going across the network. Because the 
message will be encrypted through authentication process
using the receiver’s public key and can only be decrypted by
the receivers private key and that are not available over on
the network

Since passwords/passphrase are recorded by them, it would be not 
secure when they tapped into our keyboards. Because they would get
authentication as a passphrase through the private key and they
would be able to decrypt all the data during the session as well as
they would be able to generate session key from the passphrase 
they got from the keyboard taps.

When they are booting with a USB, they can now use the private
key to decrypt any messages so, password/passphrase wouldn’t be 
secure. They can make themselves as a root of the environment and 
thus can have access to all the public and private keys, which they
can use for decrypt and encrypt.

2.

gpg —verigy: It doesn’t verify the original owner/sender of the file
but it does compare the cleartext signature once data is decrypted using
public key. So, public key doesn’t indicate who the file is belongs too,
but verifies the documents

to Fix this problem, we have to keep track of the public keys, and
we can hire organization that does keep track of the public keys. As
an example it could be a third party.
