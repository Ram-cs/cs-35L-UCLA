lab4.txt is the description of the lab that  i have done and 
noticed while ran the command as i did the work

First i downloaded the coreutils old version that had bug
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter17/cs35L/assign/
coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz


Once download file saved as coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz

unzip source file
tar -zxvf coreutils-with-bug.tar.gz

After unzip, went to the directory  
cd coreutils-with-bug/

Build configure the file
./configure

and execute the file 
make

But got an error
In file included from utimecmp.c:41:0:
utimens.h:2:5: error: conflicting types for 'futimens'
 int futimens (int, char const *, struct timespec const [2]);
     ^~~~~~~~

'futimens' was here extern int futimens (int __fd, const

Once fond the error, I went and downloaded the patch
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter17/cs35L/assign/
coreutils.diff

Patch download as 
coreutils.diff

applied the patch to see the error
patch -p0 < coreutils.diff

patching file lib/utimens.c
patching file lib/utimens.h
patching file src/copy.c
patching file src/tee.c
patching file src/touch.c

Once patched, 

make

This time no error found, because it seems that patch fixed the
bugs of coreutils

so created three files using below command
$ tmp=$(mktemp -d)
$ cd $tmp
$ touch -d '1918-11-11 11:00 GMT' wwi-armistice
$ touch now
$ sleep 1
$ touch now1

I checked to print out the date created: 
$ TZ=UTC0 ls -lt --full-time wwi-armistice now now1

-rw-r--r-- 1 yadav csugrad 0 2017-02-10 06:45:59.313970740 +0000 now1
-rw-r--r-- 1 yadav csugrad 0 2017-02-10 06:45:46.022617072 +0000 now
-rw-r--r-- 1 yadav csugrad 0 1918-11-11 11:00:00.000000000 +0000 wwi-armistice

I found the order of file is not accurate because wwi-armistice would be on the first.

I guessed that it may be because of the problem in src code

it went to source code cd /src/ls

ran the GDB
(gdb) info functions

in GDB used,
: break <function_name> - set a break point
: s - step into function
:bt - shows stack
: si
: f - Gives name of current function
: finish - runs everything till exit
: c - continue
: q- quit

I set a break point at function timespec_cmp
int diff = a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec;
    return diff ? diff : a.tv_nsec - b.tv_nsec;

it may be because of integer overflow because a.tv_sec - b.tv_sec gives
very large negative number. It can be fixed by return negative(A<B), zero(A ==B), and positive(A>B)

then created diff of this timespec.h 

diff -u coreutils-with-bug/lib/timespec.h coreutils-with-bug-new/lib/timespec.h
> lab4.diff

Then added changelog entry and appended to diff files

ran s -lt, gave the correct result

The Local file in system on SEASnet is a 64 bit file system while tmp
folder is 32bit file system. Time sorted in a 64 bit system is a combination of +  and - sign and time elapsed since 1970. The reason it shows future time is because
when convert time from 64 to 32 bit, - sign lost.
