        * src/diff.c: Changed grave accents to apostrophes

then ran the general command

used emacs src/cmp.c
   C-x 4 a and 
   C-x C-f
and I write "change all "`" to "'" "

commit changes to the new branch
   git add .
   git commit -F ./src/ChangeLog

git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patched.txt

My partner is Chungchhay Kuoch (UID:004843308)
   git checkout -b partner v3.0
   git am < /Users/RamYadav/Desktop/LAB9/diffutils/formatted-patch.txt

   Then I apply following steps:
   ./bootstrap
   cd lib
  wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter17/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff
  patch -p1 < diffutils-gets.diff
  cd ..
  ./configure
  make
  make check
  diff . -
  diff --help

make distdir
It create a new directory called "diffutils-3.0.1-7840" under diffutils
emacs diffutils*/ChangeLog
The content in this file is the same as my ChangeLog.

First I download and install XQuartz from website.
ssh -X classxxx@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu
export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH
git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
cd emacs
gitk

at the end i took the snapshot.
